## My encounter with Taoism and Physics

My first official encounter with Taoism can be traced back to 2018, when I just graduated from high school. Before then, I had little knowledge of Taoism - Tai-Chi was the most notable form of practice, but I had heard of mixed comments. During that summer before college, with the "try-it-myself" experimentalist mindset, I went out all the way to the Wudang Mountains (武当山) - where Taoism prospered for thousands of years - to figure it out for myself. There, I learned and practiced Tai-chi (三十六式 & 八段锦), standing post (Zhàn zhuāng 站桩), and meditation (打坐).

Then my college life began at Harvey Mudd in Claremont, CA. With the college's liberal arts atmosphere, I was exposed to various humanities and social science subjects. Meanwhile, in such environment, I was introduced to the fascinating world of physics even though I was already super passionate about biotechnology and life science. In the end, I decided to even pursue a major in physics as I found myself indulged in learning physics - I am completely fascianted by the beauty of the subject by seeing complicated systems to be "dictated" by simple neat formulas. Throughout these learning experience in physics and some religious courses that I have taken, I have observed some striking similarities between physics and Taoist ideas that originiated over 2000 years ago.
