## Overview

My first official encounter with Taoism can be traced back to 2018, when I just graduated from high school. Before then, I had little knowledge of Taoism - Tai-Chi was the most notable form of practice, and I had heard of mixed comments. During that summer before college, with the "try-it-myself" experimentalist mindset, I went out all the way to the Wudang Mountains (武当山) - where Taoism prospered for thousands of years - to figure it out for myself. There, I learned and practiced Tai-chi (三十六式 & 八段锦), standing post (Zhàn zhuāng 站桩), and meditation (打坐).
