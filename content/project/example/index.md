## Abstract:

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mtb coinfections remain one of the
leading causes of death due to infectious disease worldwide, causing ~1.5
million deaths every year [1]. T cell-mediated immunity is essential for
containment of Mtb infections. Early murine and nonhuman primate (NHP)
studies have illustrated that loss of CD4+ T cells abrogates control [2]. Here we
sought to investigate how concomitant Mtb infection modulates host
response to reinfection, and we assess the mechanisms by which CD4+ T cells
coordinate the hostâ€™s immune response. Mtb-infected and uninvolved tissues
from cynomolgus macaques were collected. The tissues were homogenized to
measure bacterial burden and to generate single cell suspensions for singlecell
RNA-seq. With the scRNA-seq data, we have detected gene expression
programs, including cell identity programs and activity programs, that are
differentially enriched across the non-human primate cohorts. Collectively,
our data illustrate that CD4+ T cells are required for protection against Mtb
reinfection, and cytotoxicity rather than cytokine secretion is in control of Mtb.

## Key findings - T cell correlates of immunologic control in Mtb-infected tissues:

GEP1 (FURIN T Cells) has gene signatures associated with T17 (IL18RAP, IL23R, IL2RA) and dysfunctional T cell responses (LAG3, ENTPD1, TIGIT, CTLA4) [3]. Enriched usage of GEP1 is correlated with high bacterial burden. This suggests that T17-like cellular activities and dysfunctional or exhausted T cells correlates with Mtb progression.
GEP2 (TEMRA Cells) has gene signatures associated with vascular cytotoxic T cells (CX3CR1, KLF3, GZMH, S1PR5) [4].
Enriched usage of GEP2 is correlated with low bacterial burden. This suggests that the effector and memory CD8+ T cells help control Mtb, with CD4+ T cells potentially serve as a modulator. The correlational analyses from GEP1 and GEP2 suggest that CD4+ T cells are critical in modulating CD8+ T cell responses during reinfection, potentially helping the effector memory cells to recall responses from previous infections.
