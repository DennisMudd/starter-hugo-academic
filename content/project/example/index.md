Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mtb coinfections remain one of the
leading causes of death due to infectious disease worldwide, causing ~1.5
million deaths every year [1]. T cell-mediated immunity is essential for
containment of Mtb infections. Early murine and nonhuman primate (NHP)
studies have illustrated that loss of CD4+ T cells abrogates control[2]. Here we
sought to investigate how concomitant Mtb infection modulates host
response to reinfection, and we assess the mechanisms by which CD4+ T cells
coordinate the hostâ€™s immune response. Mtb-infected and uninvolved tissues
from cynomolgus macaques were collected. The tissues were homogenized to
measure bacterial burden and to generate single cell suspensions for singlecell
RNA-seq. With the scRNA-seq data, we have detected gene expression
programs, including cell identity programs and activity programs, that are
differentially enriched across the non-human primate cohorts. Collectively,
these data illustrate that CD4+ T cells are required for protection against Mtb
reinfection, and cytotoxicity rather than cytokine secretion is in control of Mtb.
